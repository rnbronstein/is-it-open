<h2>Project Description</h2>
The purpose of this project is to implement Test Driven Development (TDD) and create well structured and written code. In other words, we are emphasizing well tested and good code over extensive functionality. 

It's all about tests and robust code.

<h2>Testing</h2>
- Rspec for the unit tests.
- Capybara for the views.
- Rubocop for the code formatting.

<h2>Contibute!</h2>
Although this is a Flatiron School project, we welcome other students and developers to contribute to the code. Check out the issues page to get started. You can find the live version of IsItOpen on http://xxxxxxxxxxxx.herokuapp.com
